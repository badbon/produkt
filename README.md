Text file based time-blocking.
New line is a new entry. Ignores newlines beginning tabs for formatting, so the .txt file can be used both as planning todo lists and actually serving as a dynamic reminder.

Made for my own personal use, to replace Trello and Google Docs clutter and simplify workflow.
